# Word-Cloud
The repository contain the text analysis project where I have draw the word cloud using R language to describe the highest frequency word used by US president Donald Trump in his speeches. The code is written in R language so to execute the code you need first install Rstudio which is the better option otherwise can use any other R supported IDE. After getting the R IDE, please download the dataset file i.e. speeches.txt and the code resite on the ode section of this repository. While executing the code you need to install various libraries which I have depicts in my code and I have well commented the code for understanding easily.

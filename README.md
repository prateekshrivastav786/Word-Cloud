# Word-Cloud
The repository contain the text analysis project where I have draw the word cloud using R language to describe the highest frequency word used by US president Donald Trump in his speeches. 
The code is writte in R langauge so to execute the code you need first install Rstudio which is better option otherwise can use any other R supported IDE.
After getting the R IDE , please download the dataset file i.e. speeches.txt and the code resite on the ode section of this repository.
While executing the code you need to install varios libraries which I have depicts in my code and I have well commented the code for understaning easily.
